The source code is covered under an altered Boost license with the main change that we do not allow any binary distribution at this point
Since this is the first time, we are open sourcing a major project, we would like to control the release of binaries, that are inevitably linked to our name, for the time being and build and distribute them ourselves through our site. This does not mean that this rule will not be relaxed in the future, but for now this limitation is in place.
